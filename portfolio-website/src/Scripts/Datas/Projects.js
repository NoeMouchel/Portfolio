I made all editor functionalities and designed the user interface using ImGui. Then I created our own particle system. The renderer engine was also developped by me and it support PBR materials and shadows from all type of lights.",

Because it was our first school project on unreal engine we had to only use blueprint so I also found the time to make all the 3D assets on blender. This game is a one level 3D platformer in which you play as a little mushroom, your goal is to reach the beautiful blossom tree at the top of the cave !",
